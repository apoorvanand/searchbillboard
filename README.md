Query Billboard for stats about songs and artists in their charts.

This example app shows getting the billboard chart for a particular date using [billboard-top-100](https://github.com/darthbatman/billboard-top-100). Just enter the date (YYYY-MM-DD) of the Saturday you want, and it'll return the Top 100 billboard chart for that week.
